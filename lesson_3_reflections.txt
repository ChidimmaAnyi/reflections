* When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Fill in your answer:
I would use a remote repository when I want to have my work in the GitHub cloud, perhaps for purposes of sharing or contribution.

* Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Fill in your answer: 
By pulling changes manually, I am sure that my work both on the local and remote is synchronized. Nothing is left to chance that way.
